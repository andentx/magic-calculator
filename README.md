# Magic Calculator

A calculator built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is designed to look like the Apple Magic Keyboard.

## Notes

This is a project from The Odin Project's foundations track. I built this to gain experience with CSS styling and programming with JavaScript.

## Features

-   Chained calculations
-   Keyboard support
-   Responsive design

## What's Next

-   Implementing the entire Magic Keyboard would be a fun challenge

-   I might also try to make this into a React component that can be added to different projects
