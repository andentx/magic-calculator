## Introduction

This is a project from The Odin Project's foundations track. I built this to gain experience with CSS styling and programming with JavaScript.

<br />

The layout of this calculator matches the one on my keyboard, which improves my ability to type
quickly. It also differs from most calculators by showing the operator and not the
result when chaining operations. I prefer this way as I'm less likely to lose track
of my last input.

## Features

-   Chained calculations
-   Keyboard support
-   Responsive design

## To Do

-   Implement backspace functionality
-   Implement chaining equals key functionality
-   Improve loading of background image

## Bugs and Issues

-   Early equals key press disables number presses
-   Multiple equals key presses not functioning
-   Background image file size is too large
-   Clicks using trackpad and tablet are adding space around 'clear' and 'enter' text

## What's Next

-   Learn how to organize the JavaScript in a better way
-   Implementing the entire Magic Keyboard would be a fun challenge
-   I might also try to make this into a React component that can be added to different projects
